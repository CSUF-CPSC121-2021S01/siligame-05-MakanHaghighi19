## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
In this milestone we were supposed to finish the game and actually make a fully functional game by using our clicker to shoot our players weapons.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
Definatly the hardest part of this milestone was making it so the screen would update with the game over and score on the game screen. Also the inactive function because that gave me some major issues for several hours.

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
I learned to never give up and that it is always good to get some feedback from others who have finished the project. I also learned how to make a score counter for my game that actually interacts with the actions that are happening in my game.
